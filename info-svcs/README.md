# Introduction to Python
Introduction to Python course aimed at complete beginners.

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the fundamentals of computer programming and to build your confidence in self-study. For the duration of the course we will be covering general programming concepts and structures which are not exclusive to Python and exist in other programming languages as well.

The course is based on the wonderful Jupyter Notebooks which you can install from [here](http://jupyter.org/install). Alternatively, if you are from the University of Edinburgh you can access the programming environment using [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) which can be accessed through the accompanying learn course *Introdcution to Python*. You can self-enrol in the course at take it at your own pace via the self-enrol tab on [Learn](https://learn.ed.ac.uk).

## Structure

### Part 0
Short intro to the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.

### Part 1
Basic programming concepts - variables, types, operations and user interaction.

### Part 2
Higher level data structures, if statements, loops, functions and classes.

### Further Exercises
A compilation of additional exercises covering the previous material.

Part 1 and 2 come with exercises in the end.

It is estimated that the notebooks should take a user an average of 4 hours to complete.

# Python for Data Science
This is an introductionary course for Using Python for Data Science applications. In the recent years Python has became extremely popular within the data science communities mainly due to its ease of use, open-source nature and the fact that it is completely free. This couse aims to introduce newcomers to the most popular packages used today - numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Note that it assumes basic knowledge of python (i.e. lists, dicts, indexing).

This is entirely self-contained and self-pased. You can do it in your own time and it shouldn't take more than 6 hours to go throught all of the material. However, this course is by no means a complete guide to using Python for data science applications. It serves the purpose of an introduction into the world of data analysis and make you comfortable with looking at seemingly random numbers and trying to extract meeting from them.

The course is based on the wonderful Jupyter Notebooks which you can install from [here](http://jupyter.org/install). Alternatively, if you are from the University of Edinburgh you can access the programming environment using [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) which can be accessed through the accompanying learn course (search for *Python for Data Science* coourse on [Learn](https://learn.ed.ac.uk)).

## Structure
The course is split into 6 different notebooks:

### Notebook 0
Short intro to Jupyter Notebooks.

### Notebook 1
Python basic concepts refresher.

### Notebook 2
Challenges you to do sentiment analysis on a sample text.

### Notebook 3
Introduction to vectorised computing and dealing with large data.

### Notebook 4
Fun exercise to test your understanding of how data flows through Python.

### Notebook 5
Introduction to the numpy package and structing large data.

### Notebook 6
Introduction to plotting in python using matplotlib.
